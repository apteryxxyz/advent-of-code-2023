# Advent of Code 2023

I will be doing the AOC 2023 with a twist, I will use a wheel to decide the language I will use for each day.

The wheel consists of ten different languages, and includes both ones I know and ones I don't know. I will potentially add more languages to the wheel if I feel like it.
